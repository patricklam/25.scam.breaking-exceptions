We describe a methodology for detecting and verifying newly added unchecked exceptions in a library when it is updated from an older version to a newer one. Our focus is on identifying the impact of such changes on client code. Specifically, we analyze client programs to detect usage of library methods that now throw previously non-existent unchecked exceptions. These exceptions may introduce behavioral breaking changes that are difficult to detect through traditional compiler checks, as compilers typically enforce handling only for checked exceptions.
We begin by collecting both the client programs and the necessary information to perform our analysis. Specifically, we extract all external library methods invoked by the client. For each of these methods, we analyze their implementation in both the version of the library currently used by the client and the latest version. This allows us to compare their behavior across versions. If we find that a method now throws a newly added unchecked exception in the latest version, and that the exception is reachable from the client code, we manually write test cases to verify the presence of behavioral breaking changes in the client due to the newly introduced exception.
