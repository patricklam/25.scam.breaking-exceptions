% look for citations about library usage
The use of libraries developed by others is ubiquitous in modern
software development~\cite{huang22:_charac_java,wang20:_java}. Libraries enable developers to include
functionality in their own client software without having to
implement it themselves.  However, libraries developed by others are
also updated by others, on schedules that are not controlled by the client developers.

When one is developing software that is exposed to the Internet, one
has a responsibility to incorporate security updates for the
libraries that one is using as a client~\cite{wu23:_under_threat_upstr_vulner_downs}, or else risk vulnerabilities
being exposed in one's software~\cite{haryono22:_autom_ident_librar_vulner_data,zhan21:_atvhun,alfadel23:_empir_python}. The obligation to update libraries is
a form of technical debt that accrues automatically with the passage
of time.

However, upgrading libraries is not painless~\cite{elizalde18:_towar_smoot_librar_migrat,derr17:_keep,dann23:_upcy}: new
versions of libraries may include breaking Application Programming
Interface (API) changes~\cite{dietrich14:_broken}, requiring developers to verify that their own
code continues working with the new library versions. This is
inconvenient at best and can require hours of software development at worst,
often without the reward of useful new features in the client software---they
just allow the client software to continue working, in a hopefully less-vulnerable
state.

Compilers and simple static
checkers~\cite{brito18:_apidif,foo18:_effic_static_check_librar_updat}
can verify the absence of syntactic breaking changes in libraries,
e.g. changes to signatures of public methods, retractions of
formerly-existing methods, or even syntactic changes to library method
implementations. The situation is worse for semantic breaking changes:
there do not exist techniques for reliably detecting such changes. Of
course, in its full generality, the problem is undecidable, though
breaking change detection can be estimated using program analysis
techniques.

In this work, we contribute a way to detect one type of potentially breaking
change in a library. Our work enables client developers to identify changes
to the set of exceptions that may be thrown by a Java library, particularly
by the APIs that are actually used by client code. We leverage taint analysis
to reduce the number of false positives that we report to client developers,
and show only changed APIs that may realistically throw new exceptions
in updated versions, minimizing the number of false positives~\cite{pashchenko20:_vuln4,pashchenko18:_vulner}. % something about making it easy to show test cases.

We explore the following research questions:

\noindent
{\bf RQ1.} How often do published changes to Java libraries include new added exceptions,
and under what circumstances do such exceptions occur (e.g. major/minor/patch versions)?

\noindent
{\bf RQ2.} Do library clients, in practice, call methods with new added exceptions, and is it possible for the clients to trigger these exceptions? Is it possible to write client test cases that trigger the exceptions?

%RQ1: Do libraries have breaking changes in the form of added exceptions?
%RQ2: Do clients call the methods which have these breaking changes, and can we trigger the new exceptions?

%true, [RQ1] I think even logically it would make sense to showcase that libraries do add new unchecked exceptions (UE). We can even do something about the version in which they are adding the UE (do they introduce the UE in major version or minor version or patch version). [RQ2] Then we can follow it up with how often do clients call such method which have a newly added UE and can we trigger those UE (the taint analysis part can be defended along with it).
